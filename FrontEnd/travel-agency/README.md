Features
Navigation: Easily explore trips across across several continents in the destinations menu. Navigate through categories to find trips depending on whether you want to travel solo, in a group, for honeymoon or with family.

Homepage: Two carousel sections (with bootstrap's blessings). One displays the top 5 trips, dynamically retrieved from the database and according to the highest amount of reservations made for those trips.

Account: Sign up to create a customer account. Log in to reserve and manage trips.
Profile: The user can edit his credentials.

Trip cards: Trip card display trip related information and a form that is directly populated with user information. The user select number of travellers and submit to reserve the trip.

Reservations: It displays a list of trips in rows. Each row contains basic trip info and buttons to see trip details or cancel the reservation. When the administrator is logged in, the list contains all reservations made by users and every row contains a 'Approve' button. Communication is hypothetically made via email outside the application.
